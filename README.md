# DataStructureCheatSheet

A simple website that visually explains fundamental data structures to help undergrad students learn key concepts quickly and easily.

## Overview
The goal is to make data structures approachable by providing:
- Visual guides for common data structures (like stacks, queues, linked lists, etc.)
- Interactive examples to demonstrate operations (e.g., insertion, deletion)
- A clear, simple interface that focuses on what students need to know

## Features (In Progress)
- **Arrays, Stacks, Queues**: Visual operations like push, pop, and enqueue
- **Linked Lists**: Examples of traversing and inserting nodes
- **Trees and Graphs**: Basic traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS)
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort
